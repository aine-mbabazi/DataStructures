# DataStructures
This repository contains work on different data structures.
It contains work on tuples, stacks and queues.

## Tuples
Tuples are an ordered collection of elements.Elements in a tuple are separated by commas.
They are immutable which means changes can not be made to them. They cannot be modified but they can be duplicated.
Some advantages of a tuple are safety, and efficiency. Disadvantage of tuples is less convinient. Immutability is a both advantage and disadvantage of a tuple since it is immutable meaning it cannot be chaged. Tuples are use to insert records to a data base and it is used as a parenthesis checker

## Stacks
Stacks hold linear ordered sequence of elements. They  are an abstract data structure.The last element  inserted in a tack is the  first element that will be removed.
When adding elements to a stack, we use the push operator.
When removing items, the pop operator is used to remove the last or top most element from a stack.

## Queues
A queue is a linear data structure.
There are three types of queues namely the First in first out where the first item added to the collection of items is the first to be retrieved or removed.
The priority queue is where the is where entries are kept sorted and one with the lowest value is retrieved first.
The last in first out queue is where the last elements added tothe collection are the first to be retrieved.
Advantage of queues is that they are flexible while on main disadvantage is that they are not readily searchable because they  take  o(N) time to search.
